# Design-Statistical-Models
This repository, contains the Jupyter notebooks and datasets companions to the OpenClassrooms course: [Design Statistical Models](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5873596-perform-effective-data-modeling)


## Part I

We start with the core concepts required to build linear regression models

* Linearity
* Correlation
* Hypothesis testing

## Part II
We move on to univariate and multivariate linear regression.
We start with hands-on applications  to standard datasets and follow up with the underlying theoretical basis.

* Univariate and multivariate linear regression
* The 5 assumptions of linear regression
* The mathematical basis for Linear regression

## Part III
We expand the framework of linear regression for classification, handling categorical variables and polynomial regression.

* Logistic regression
* Dealing with categorical variables
* Polynomial regression

## Part IV
In the last part we move from statistical modeling to a predictive analytics approach and address overfitting, cross validation and classification metrics.

* Predicting with linear regression
* Classification metrics and model selection

The datasets are available in the /data folder.
